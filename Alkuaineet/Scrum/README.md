# Scrum
Kouluprojekti SCRUM

We created this together as a group. There were four of us in the team, and the goal was to practice using SCRUM tools while coding this program. We had three days to implement a program that asks the user about the first 20 elements of the periodic table. The user lists elements, and the program checks whether they are among the first 20.

I will mark my own code with comments "*".

My role was to be the product owner. In class ChemicalElementProgram I made the base of the class with all the methods and then we together
started to write the funktionality into it. So my job was to desing and think about how the program should work.
